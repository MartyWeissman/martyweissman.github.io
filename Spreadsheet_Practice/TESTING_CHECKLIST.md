## Cross-Lesson Compatibility Tests

### Variable Isolation
Open console and verify variables are isolated:

```javascript
// After loading Lesson 1
Lesson1.getStudentName()
// Should return the current student name or "student"

// Load Lesson 2
// After loading Lesson 2
Lesson2.getStudentName()
// Should return "student" (reset)

// Verify Lesson 1 still has its own state
Lesson1.getStudentName()
// Should still return its own value
```

- [ ] Each lesson maintains its own `studentName` variable
- [ ] Loading one lesson doesn't affect another lesson's internal state
- [ ] No global variable conflicts appear in console

### Rapid Lesson Switching
